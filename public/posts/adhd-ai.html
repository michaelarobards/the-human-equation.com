  <p>
    Attention‑deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often misunderstood as simply a lack of attention.
    In reality, it is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that affects executive function,
    time management and emotional regulation. Clients with ADHD frequently struggle with
    procrastination, forgetfulness and overwhelm, even when they deeply care about their
    responsibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Artificial intelligence, when used thoughtfully, can act as a bridge between therapy
    sessions. Tools like AI‑powered assistants can help clients organize tasks, break
    projects into manageable steps and set gentle reminders. Chatbots can offer
    nonjudgmental check‑ins and reflective questions that prompt users to notice their
    emotional state before it escalates.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    "AI can’t replace the human relationship in therapy, but it can support clients
    between sessions by providing structure, accountability and self‑reflection."
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    In our practice, we encourage ADHD clients to experiment with AI tools that align
    with their goals. For example, scheduling apps can send reminders at the right
    moment, while journaling bots can help clients process their feelings in real time.
    Importantly, we emphasize ethical use — clients should understand how their data
    is stored, set boundaries around notifications and never rely on AI as a substitute
    for human support.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re curious about integrating AI into your ADHD toolkit, start small. Choose
    one tool that addresses a specific challenge, like remembering appointments or
    organizing tasks. Then evaluate how it affects your daily life and discuss it
    with your therapist. AI works best when it complements, rather than replaces,
    therapeutic relationships.
