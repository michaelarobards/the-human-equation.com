      <p>
        Most divorces don’t begin with fights.  
        They begin with silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not the peaceful kind — the kind that grows heavy, dense, and impossible to name.  
        The silence that forms in the gap between two people who once reached for each other  
        and now retreat without meaning to.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Emotional withdrawal is one of the quietest forms of relational betrayal.  
        It doesn’t leave bruises or evidence.  
        It leaves questions — the kind you carry alone at night because you can’t imagine how to say them out loud.
      </p>

      <h2>The Withdrawal Before the Ending</h2>

      <p>
        When emotional withdrawal becomes chronic, the marriage ends long before the paperwork is filed.  
        You feel it first as a tension in your body — a sense that you are living beside someone rather than with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then routines begin to shift:  
        fewer conversations, shorter goodnights, more time on phones, more time apart,  
        more unspoken resentment that builds quietly in the walls of the home.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “The erosion of a marriage is almost never loud. It is the slow collapse of emotional availability.”
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Identity Collapse</h2>

      <p>
        Divorce isn’t just the dissolution of a legal structure — it is the collapse of an identity.  
        Who you were inside the marriage no longer exists.  
        Who you will become after the marriage has not yet emerged.
      </p>

      <p>
        That in-between place is where people feel most lost.  
        Not broken — disoriented.  
        Because:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The story you lived no longer makes sense.</li>
        <li>The story you’re moving into hasn’t revealed itself yet.</li>
        <li>Your internal narrative collapses under the weight of unmet needs and unspoken grief.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is where I meet most people — in the space between “who I was” and “who I am becoming.”
      </p>

      <h2>The Moment You Begin Rebuilding</h2>

      <p>
        Healing starts the moment you realize something simple but transformational:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “People don’t break. Stories break.  
        And stories can be rewritten.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        You don’t heal by going back to the person you were.  
        You heal by becoming the person your life is now asking you to become.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the heart of narrative repair — the ability to re-author the story that was fractured.
      </p>

      <h2>The Work That Follows</h2>

      <p>
        After the silent chapter of divorce comes the work:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>rebuilding emotional safety,</li>
        <li>learning attachment patterns,</li>
        <li>reconstructing identity,</li>
        <li>reshaping your internal dialogue,</li>
        <li>and rediscovering meaning.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This isn’t quick work. But it is possible.  
        And it is the work that changes everything.
      </p>

      <h2>You Are Not Alone</h2>

      <p>
        Divorce feels isolating because the story breaks in private long before it breaks in public.  
        But healing — true healing — does not happen alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        It happens in community.  
        With people who have walked this road.  
        With structure.  
        With clarity.  
        With language for your experience.  
        With weekly consistency until the next version of your life becomes real.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “There is a version of you on the other side of this.  
        A version with a clearer identity, deeper relationships, and a reclaimed story.”
      </blockquote>
