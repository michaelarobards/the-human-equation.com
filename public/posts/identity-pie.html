    <h1>The Identity Pie</h1>
    <p>Rebuilding the self by realigning your roles, your values, and your time</p>

  <p>
    She didn’t realize her life was out of balance until she tried to answer a deceptively simple
    question: <strong>“What are the most important roles in your life?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    We were in a family session after a difficult co-parenting week. She stared at the floor, her voice
    thin from carrying everything alone. Finally she said:
  </p>

  <p><strong>“Being a mother is the most important thing in my life.”</strong></p>

  <p>
    Then, almost whispered:
    <strong>“So why does it feel like every week I do everything except actually be one?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is the moment people meet the <strong>Identity Pie</strong> for the first time — not as an
    exercise or prompt, but as truth. A mirror.
  </p>

  <h2>Identity Isn’t Who You Are — It’s Who You Prioritize</h2>

  <p>
    Most people think identity is personality. It isn’t. Identity is the constellation of
    <strong>roles</strong> that make up a meaningful life — roles you choose, roles you value, roles you
    refuse to lose.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my Identity Pie model, we begin by listing the roles that truly matter to you. Roles like:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Father</li>
    <li>Mother</li>
    <li>Partner</li>
    <li>Professional</li>
    <li>Friend</li>
    <li>Son / Daughter</li>
    <li>Athlete</li>
    <li>Artist / Creator</li>
    <li>Spiritual self</li>
    <li>Builder</li>
    <li>Community member</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    There is no right number of slices. Identity is personal, seasonal, alive.
  </p>

  <p>
    We begin with one question:
    <strong>“Which roles matter most — and how big is each slice when measured by value, not time?”</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>The Time Pie — The Mirror That Doesn’t Lie</h2>

  <p>
    Once the Identity Pie is drawn, we create the <strong>Time Pie</strong>. This one is not emotional.
    It is data-driven. It shows where your hours actually go — work, conflict, caretaking, survival
    tasks, everything that consumes you.
  </p>

  <p>
    And almost universally, people discover:
  </p>

  <p><strong>The role they value most is the role that receives the least time.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Parents who say children are their top priority find that work consumes 60 hours and stress consumes
    the rest. Partners who long for intimacy give everything to conflict management instead. Men who
    identify fatherhood as their anchor spend their weeks doing everything but connecting.
  </p>

  <p>
    The gap between <em>what matters</em> and <em>what gets your time</em> is where identity pain comes
    from. The Time Pie exposes that gap without judgment. It simply tells the truth.
  </p>

  <h2>Identity Pain Lives in the Space Between Value and Time</h2>

  <p>
    The psychological injury doesn’t come from divorce or conflict alone. It comes from the
    disorientation of living out of alignment:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>“Who I want to be”</strong><br>
    versus<br>
    <strong>“Who my life is forcing me to be.”</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    When value and time diverge:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>parents feel like failures</li>
    <li>professionals burn out</li>
    <li>partners disconnect</li>
    <li>men lose their spark</li>
    <li>women lose their center</li>
    <li>individuals feel fraudulent inside their own lives</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Identity Pie doesn’t accuse you. It liberates you.
  </p>

  <h2>Reconstructing the Self — A Practical, Honest Path</h2>

  <p>Identity reconstruction in my model requires three commitments:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reclaiming roles you abandoned out of survival</strong> — not weakness.</li>
    <li><strong>Shrinking roles that devoured you</strong> — work, conflict, chronic over-functioning.</li>
    <li><strong>Redistributing your time to reflect your values</strong> — a life that matches what matters.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is where the Identity Pie becomes more than a tool. It becomes a <strong>map</strong>. And you
    become its author.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Identity Work Is Central to The Human Equation</h2>

  <p>
    You cannot repair a relationship — or co-parent well — or heal from betrayal — or build a life that
    feels true —
    <strong>without rebuilding yourself.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Identity work is the foundation of everything we do in The Human Equation:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Modern Fatherhood</li>
    <li>Modern Motherhood</li>
    <li>Identity After Divorce</li>
    <li>Parenting Teens</li>
    <li>Reunification Therapy</li>
    <li>Attachment Repair</li>
    <li>The Insight Series (when deeper tools are needed)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Identity Pie shows you where you lost yourself — and where you will find yourself again.
  </p>

  <h2>You Are Not Starting Over — You Are Starting True</h2>

  <p>
    When people complete their first Identity Pie, they often say:
    <strong>“I didn’t realize how small I made myself.”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    But here’s the beauty:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Slices can grow.</li>
    <li>Slices can shrink.</li>
    <li>Slices can be reborn.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Identity is not fixed. It is chosen.  
    And now — finally — <strong>you get to choose again.</strong>
  </p>
