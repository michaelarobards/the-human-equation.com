  <p>
    Life rarely goes according to plan. Divorce, illness, job loss, estrangement and
    identity shifts can shatter the sense of harmony you’ve built. The question is not
    whether storms will come — but how you will weather them without losing yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Harmony is not the absence of conflict; it’s the ability to stay grounded in who you
    are while adapting to new realities. In music, harmony arises when different notes
    complement each other rather than competing. In life, harmony arises when your
    identities — parent, professional, friend, individual — work together rather than
    cannibalizing each other.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    "Harmony isn't about everything being perfect; it's about staying in tune with yourself
    when the melody changes."
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    To find harmony after a major upheaval, start with self‑compassion. Acknowledge the
    pain and confusion without judging yourself for feeling it. Then get curious: what
    parts of your identity have been neglected? What new opportunities are emerging?
    Use tools like the <a href="/posts/identity-pie.html">Identity Pie</a> to map out
    where you’re devoting your energy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Harmony often requires community. Surround yourself with people who can reflect
    your strengths back to you and support your growth. In our groups, I’ve watched
    members transition from crisis to leadership by sharing their stories, learning new
    skills and taking responsibility for their part of the equation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember: harmony is dynamic. As you grow and circumstances change, you will
    constantly retune. That’s not a sign of failure; it’s the essence of a life well lived.
