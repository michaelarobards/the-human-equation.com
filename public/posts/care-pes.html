    As artificial intelligence becomes more integrated into mental health care, clinicians and
    developers must ensure that these tools are used ethically, safely and equitably. The
    <strong>CARE-PES</strong> framework was developed to provide a practical roadmap for
    evaluating AI systems in clinical settings. It stands for Cultural sensitivity,
    Accessibility, Reliability, Empathy, Privacy, Equity and Synergy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cultural sensitivity:</strong> AI tools should be aware of cultural differences
    and avoid stereotyping or reinforcing harmful norms. They need to recognize that
    emotional expression, family structure and values vary widely across cultures.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Ensure that AI interfaces are usable by people with
    disabilities and those with limited technology literacy. This includes clear language,
    alternative formats and respectful design.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Reliability:</strong> Clinicians must verify the accuracy of AI outputs and
    understand the limitations of predictive models. AI is a supplement to — not a
    substitute for — professional judgment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Empathy:</strong> Even automated systems should foster a sense of being seen
    and understood. Responses should be supportive, nonjudgmental and emotionally attuned.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Privacy:</strong> Safeguard user data. Clients should know what information is
    collected, how it’s used and with whom it’s shared. Opt‑in should be the default.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Equity:</strong> Evaluate AI models for bias across gender, race, sexuality,
    socioeconomic status and other identities. Mitigate disparities before deploying
    systems that may disadvantage marginalized populations.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Synergy:</strong> The ultimate goal of AI in mental health is to enhance human
    care, not replace it. Technology should support clinicians and clients in reaching
    deeper insights and stronger connections.
  </p>

    "Ethical AI doesn’t just avoid harm; it actively promotes healing, inclusion and
    cultural humility."

    At The Human Equation, we use CARE-PES as a checklist when evaluating new tools. We
    believe that combining evidence‑based practices with ethical technology can widen
    access to care while preserving the heart of therapy: relationship. Learn more
