  <p>
    A few years ago a father came to me in tears after an app told him he was an
    “unfit parent.” The tool used keywords like “anger” and “late payments” from his
    social media posts to generate a risk score. What it couldn’t see was his
    context: he worked two jobs, cared for his aging mother and expressed his
    stress online as a way to cope. The app’s judgment felt like a verdict in
    family court. That conversation pushed us to write our <strong>AI Bias
    Testing white paper</strong>. We needed a structured way to ask whether our
    digital tools were perpetuating the very inequities we’re trying to heal.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Why bias matters:</strong> Machine‑learning models are trained on
    data scraped from a world that is not equitable. If we feed unfiltered data
    into our mental health tools, they will mirror systemic racism, sexism,
    ableism and cultural prejudice. They may overpathologize Black mothers,
    misgender trans teens or dismiss trauma expressed in Indigenous languages.
    Bias isn’t an edge case — it’s woven into the fabric of our datasets. To
    avoid causing harm, we must actively look for it and design against it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>How we test:</strong> In the white paper we outline a method for
    evaluating AI outputs across multiple identity dimensions. We recruit
    volunteer testers representing diverse genders, races, abilities, sexual
    orientations and socioeconomic backgrounds. Each tester interacts with the
    tool using a standardized script (e.g., "I am feeling overwhelmed by
    parenting and work") and records the response. We then score each
    response along axes such as empathy, relevance, harmful assumptions and
    cultural appropriateness. If the average score for any identity group
    deviates significantly, we dig into the model’s training data, prompts
    and logic until we understand why.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What we found:</strong> Our tests revealed that many off‑the‑shelf
    models provide supportive messages to white, cisgender users but offer
    shallow or even harmful responses to Black users, queer users or neurodiverse
    users. For example, when testers with disabilities described fatigue, the
    AI often recommended ableist solutions like "go for a run" or "just push
    through." These findings underscore the need for continuous auditing, not
    one‑time fixes. Bias is a moving target: as models update, as language
    evolves and as new identities emerge, our evaluation must evolve too.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What you can do:</strong> If you’re developing or deploying AI in
    mental health, start with the CARE‑PES framework and layer bias testing
    on top. Use representative datasets, consult with community members and
    hire ethicists to review your tools. Build an audit loop: test, score,
    adjust, repeat. And most importantly, center lived experience. Invite
    clients to share feedback on how AI impacts them. AI should never be a
    black box; it should be transparent, accountable and humble.
  </p>

    "Bias isn’t just a bug in code; it’s a reflection of our collective
    history. The only way to heal it is to see it."

    Our white paper offers a detailed rubric, sample scripts and scoring
    templates you can adapt in your own organization. You can download the
    full document to see tables, charts and case studies. For us, bias testing
    isn’t about compliance or optics — it’s about upholding our mission:
    to make mental health support accessible, safe and affirming for
    everyone. If you’d like to explore ethical AI in practice, join our
    Insight Series modules on AI ethics and attend our monthly
    <em>Ethical Technology</em> discussion group.
