    <h2>A Lifelong Commitment to Healing</h2>
    <p>
      Michael A. RoBards, LCSW has devoted more than two decades to helping individuals, couples, and families rebuild their lives. As a licensed clinical social worker specializing in family reunification, child and family therapy, and high-conflict co-parenting, Michael blends evidence-based practice with a compassionate, narrative-focused approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over his career, he has served as Director of Evaluation &amp; Referral at The Brook Hospitals and Clinical Manager at Our Lady of Peace Hospital. He has designed and implemented custom electronic health record systems for regional treatment centers and consulted for leading organizations through The Human Equation and The Leadership Dimension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael’s work is built on the legacy of his mother, Dr. Martine J. RoBards. Together they developed the Insight Game and Insight Professional Series, pioneering resources in personality type and temperament. Their mission has been featured in <em>Psychology Today</em>, <em>INC Magazine</em>, ABC News, and beyond.

    <h2>Innovation &amp; Leadership</h2>
    <p>
      Through The Human Equation and its predecessor The Leadership Dimension, Michael has consulted with corporations like United Parcel Service, Sun Microsystems, and the University of Louisville. He helped develop leadership tools such as the Comprehensive Type-Temperament Trainer’s CD-ROM and continues to innovate at the intersection of psychology and technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      His latest work includes the CARE-PES framework for ethical, culturally sensitive AI in mental health, and ongoing research in ADHD support tools. Michael is also writing a memoir, <em>Tides of Change</em>, and co-authoring <em>The Therapist’s Guide to Divorce and Co-Parenting</em>.

    <h2>Community &amp; Connection</h2>
    <p>
      Michael believes that healing happens in community. During the COVID-19 pandemic he launched thriving support communities on Discord, proving that digital gathering spaces can foster lasting, meaningful connections. Today, the Insight Groups continue that work, blending structured identity development with the natural warmth of human connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of clinical work, Michael is a father of seven and frequently accompanied by his therapy dog, Jack. He knows that resilience and growth are possible even in the face of betrayal, estrangement, and trauma — and it’s his life’s work to share that hope with others.

    <h2>Projects &amp; Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Michael’s philosophy is rooted in the belief that courtrooms cannot mend family bonds — therapy and community can. He continues to advocate for family court reform, modern fatherhood, and inclusive support for all parents navigating identity reconstruction.
