  <!-- Revised narrative content for CARE-PES -->
  <p>
    The first time I sat across from an engineer eager to build a “therapist bot,” I felt
    both excited and uneasy. Excited because technology can help more people access
    support; uneasy because therapy is about relationship, humility and culture — things
    machines don’t naturally grasp. I knew we needed a map to guide these conversations.
    That map became <strong>CARE‑PES</strong>, an ethical framework that keeps humans at
    the center of AI in mental health. Each letter is an invitation to slow down and
    reflect before launching a tool into someone’s most intimate struggles.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cultural sensitivity:</strong> No algorithm is neutral. People express pain,
    joy, anger and love differently across cultures. When we develop or deploy an AI
    system, we ask: does it honor Indigenous parenting models as much as Western ones? Does
    it understand that family roles and intimacy look different in Asian, Latinx or
    neurodiverse households? If the answer is “I’m not sure,” the tool isn’t ready.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Technology can widen access or create new barriers.
    We test our interfaces with elders who have never used smartphones, with people who
    read at a fourth‑grade level, with those who need screen readers and those living in
    rural areas with low bandwidth. If a tool can’t serve them, it doesn’t serve our
    mission.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Reliability:</strong> AI outputs aren’t gospel. They reflect patterns in
    historical data — patterns that may be biased or outdated. Every recommendation must be
    reviewed by a clinician who knows the client’s history. We treat AI like a second
    opinion: useful, but never a replacement for professional judgment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Empathy:</strong> Even a chatbot can leave you feeling more seen or more
    dismissed. We design responses that say, “I hear you,” not “I’ve calculated your
    risk score.” The tone, pacing and language of AI matters. A cold script can
    retraumatize; a warm, attuned response can offer a bridge back to connection.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Privacy:</strong> Every digital tool is a window into someone’s life. We
    insist on consent and transparency: clients must know what data is collected, how long
    it’s stored and who has access. We default to opt‑in, and we refuse to monetize
    personal stories.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Equity:</strong> Machine learning reproduces social bias unless you fight
    against it. We test our models across gender, race, ability, sexuality and
    socioeconomic status. If outcomes differ, we pause development to correct it.
    Liberation isn’t a feature request — it’s the baseline.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Synergy:</strong> At its best, technology isn’t a competitor to human
    connection; it’s a companion. An ADHD client might use a journaling bot to track
    emotions between sessions, then bring that data into therapy. A couple might use an
    AI‑assisted values exercise to reveal hidden priorities, then discuss it with their
    counselor. Synergy means AI and therapists make each other better.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    "Ethical AI isn’t about shiny features; it’s about humility — remembering that
    software should serve people, culture and healing."
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    At The Human Equation we use CARE‑PES as a checklist every time we consider
    technology. If a tool can’t meet these standards, we don’t recommend it. By
    combining evidence‑based practice with ethical AI, we widen access to support
    without sacrificing the heart of our work: relationship. To dive deeper into how we
    test for bias and inclusivity, read our
