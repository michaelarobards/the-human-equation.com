    It hits you in the most ordinary moments. You’re at your child’s soccer game, sitting on
    the cold bleachers while the late afternoon sun drops behind the trees, and you realize
    you don’t know how to introduce yourself. You’re no longer “so‑and‑so’s spouse.” You’re
    a co‑parent, a single adult, a ghost of your old identity. In that instant, a casual
    hello from your ex can feel like a seismic event.
  </p>
  <p>
    That shock comes from the way divorce blows apart our sense of self. Before separation,
    most of us stack our identity pie with two big slices: partner and parent. When one slice
    vanishes, the other swells to fill the void. Everything else—friendships, passions,
    professional growth—shrinks to slivers. A simple request about drop‑off time suddenly
    feels like an attack because there’s nothing left in the pie besides parenting.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <em>Identity&nbsp;Pie</em> exercise is designed to help you see this imbalance so you can
    gently rebuild. Draw a circle and label slices for the roles you inhabit: parent,
    professional, friend, lover, individual. Notice which pieces are consuming all the space
    and which are mere crumbs. There’s nothing magical about equal slices; what matters is
    that you deliberately nourish more than one part of yourself.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    "When your sense of self is lopsided, even a text message can feel like a threat to your identity."
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Balance is not about time, it’s about meaning. You might only have an hour for a hobby
    each week, but if it brings you alive, it counts. When you start investing emotional
    energy into friendships, creativity and personal growth, co‑parenting loses its
    explosive charge. You stop measuring your worth by the number of overnights and start
    measuring it by the quality of your presence.
  </p>
  <p>
    I often ask clients to redraw their Identity Pie every season. Which slices are
    bulging? Which haven’t been nourished in months? Then, with compassion, we make space
    for what’s missing. Maybe it’s scheduling coffee with an old friend or signing up for a
    class you always wanted to take. The goal isn’t to diminish your devotion as a parent;
    it’s to weave a stronger net so the ups and downs of co‑parenting don’t shred you.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’d like guidance, the <a href="/insight.html">Insight Series</a> takes you deeper
    into the Identity Pie along with attachment styles, personality type and values
    clarification. We also practice the Pie in our weekly groups. You don’t have to figure
    this out alone. There’s an entire community here ready to help you rebalance and
    reclaim the parts of yourself that got lost in the divorce story.
