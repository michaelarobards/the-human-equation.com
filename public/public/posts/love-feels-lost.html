    It’s 3&nbsp;a.m. and you’re both lying awake in the dark, inches apart yet feeling miles away.  
    You can still remember the early days when conversation flowed and laughter came easily, but
    lately the air between you is thick with unspoken grievances and tiredness.  
    When couples tell me they’ve “fallen out of love,” what they’re really saying is
    this: the hurt and the withdrawals have accumulated to the point that they can no longer
    access the love that brought them together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over time, small betrayals and chronic stress become layers of scar tissue around the heart.
    Resentment is not a sudden event; it’s a slow building of unanswered bids for
    connection.  
    Each dismissed feeling, every unresolved argument, reinforces the story that your
    partner isn’t safe.  Eventually, you start seeing them as an adversary rather than
    an ally.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “Most couples don’t fall out of love; they get locked out of it behind walls of
    resentment and unmet needs.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The first step in reclaiming love is <em>differentiation</em> — the ability to stay
    connected to yourself while staying emotionally close to another.  
    Differentiation lets you listen to your partner’s pain without drowning in guilt or
    defensiveness. It allows you to express your needs without blame or manipulation.  
    Without differentiation, the relationship oscillates between enmeshment and
    withdrawal.
  </p>
  <p>
    In our sessions, we slow down the conversation and track what’s happening beneath the
    words.  When partners are triggered, their nervous systems go into survival mode:
    heart rate increases, breathing gets shallow, muscles tense.  
    Learning to recognize these cues and regulate them — sometimes by simply pausing and
    placing a hand over your heart — creates space for empathy and curiosity to return.
  </p>
  <p>
    If love feels lost in your relationship, know that it often isn’t gone — it’s buried
    under layers of pain, fear and protective strategies.  
    Couples therapy and relationship groups offer a structured, compassionate place to
    practice differentiation, repair resentments and reawaken what’s been there all along.  
    The work is uncomfortable, but discovering a deeper, more resilient love on the
    other side is worth every step.
