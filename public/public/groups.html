    <p>Every group at The Human Equation is built around one simple idea: <strong>you grow faster when you grow together</strong>. Our groups are intentionally small (around 10 people), confidential, consistent, and grounded in clinical insight and identity development.</p>
    <p>When a group fills, it splits — creating more spaces for new members and leadership opportunities for those ready to step into the Builder role.</p>

<!-- Monday Groups -->
<section class="groups-section">
  <h2>Monday</h2>
  <div class="group-grid" style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr)); gap: 1.8rem; width: 90%; max-width: 1100px; margin: 3rem auto;">

      <h3>Parenting Autistic Kids &amp; Teens · 12p EST</h3>
      <p>
        Parenting a neurodivergent child means unlearning the scripts you grew up with and learning to co‑regulate with your child. In this group we practice compassionate listening, sensory‑aware strategies and advocacy skills so you can attune to your child's unique rhythms. You'll leave with a community of parents who understand what it's like and a map for building a relationship grounded in trust and acceptance.
      </p>

    <div class="group-card" style="background: #161b20; padding: 1.5rem 1.8rem; border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #2a323b;">
      <h3>Parenting Teens · 1p EST</h3>
      <p>
        The teenage years are when your child is both pulling away and desperately needing connection. Here we explore how to set firm boundaries while staying emotionally available, how to talk about sex, technology and identity without shame, and how to support your teen's journey toward adulthood without losing yourself. It's a space for parents to laugh, cry and grow as their children find their way.

      <h3>Parents of Trans &amp; GN Teens · 2p EST</h3>
      <p>
        When your child comes out, you may feel joy, fear, grief and pride all at once. This affirming group helps parents of trans and gender‑diverse kids navigate healthcare systems, schools, and family dynamics while processing their own emotions. We hold space for your journey so you can show up with unconditional love and become the advocate and ally your child needs.

      <h3>Parents Grief Group · 3:30p EST</h3>
      <p>
        There is no pain like losing a child. In this sacred space we sit together in our grief without rushing to fix it. We share stories, light candles, listen to music, and talk about what it means to live with loss while still loving. Healing begins by being witnessed and held in community.
      </p>

      <h3>Survivors of Suicide (Parents) · 4:30p EST</h3>
      <p>
        When someone you love dies by suicide, you are left with questions that may never have answers. This group offers a gentle and confidential haven for parents navigating guilt, anger, confusion and emptiness. We honour your loved one's life while exploring ways to grieve, remember and find connection amidst isolation.

      <h3>20s Men's Group · 6p EST</h3>
      <p>
        Your twenties are supposed to be fun but often feel like limbo between adolescence and adulting. In this circle we offer a modern rite of passage, where men explore who they want to be beyond careers and body metrics. We talk about purpose, vulnerability and relationships; we practice speaking from the heart and listening without fixing; and we support each other in making choices aligned with our values rather than other people's expectations.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="group-card" style="background: #161b20; padding: 1.5rem 1.8rem; border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #2a323b;">
      <h3>20s LGBTQ Group · 7p EST</h3>
      <p>
        Finding your people can be the difference between surviving and thriving. This group is for LGBTQ+ folks in their twenties looking for belonging, clarity and courage. We celebrate queer joy, unpack internalised shame, and talk about dating, family, activism and self‑care. Bring your full self — including parts that don't fit into easy labels — and find friends who get it.

<!-- Saturday Groups -->
<section class="groups-section">
  <h2>Saturday</h2>
  <div class="group-grid" style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr)); gap: 1.8rem; width: 90%; max-width: 1100px; margin: 3rem auto;">

      <h3>Modern Fatherhood · 2p EST</h3>
      <p>
        You step into this circle as a father first, but soon you'll discover you’re
        allowed to be a man, a son and a soul again. This group holds space for dads
        navigating divorce or redefining family to trade scoreboard parenting for
        presence and humility. We explore the myths of “50/50” and learn to lead
        with character instead of clocking hours. Sessions blend emotional
        regulation, self‑reflection, accountability and the quiet courage it takes
        to rebuild identity beyond the role of “Dad” alone.
      </p>

    <div class="group-card" style="background: #161b20; padding: 1.5rem 1.8rem; border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #2a323b;">
      <h3>Modern Motherhood · 3p EST</h3>
      <p>
        Motherhood often asks you to carry more than your hands can hold. This
        circle is a sanctuary for women reclaiming who they are beyond
        caretaking—especially after divorce or in high‑conflict co‑parenting. We
        untangle guilt from love, set boundaries with ex‑partners, rebuild
        support networks and reawaken joy. Expect a mix of storytelling,
        skills practice and the warmth of being fully seen. You’ll laugh, cry
        and slowly rediscover your own voice.
      </p>

    <div class="group-card" style="background: #161b20; padding: 1.5rem 1.8rem; border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #2a323b;">
      <h3>The Insight Series · 4p EST</h3>
      <p>
        This rotating workshop is the deep‑dive hub of our community. Each
        session unpacks a different lens—personality type, attachment
        patterns, values clarification, identity reconstruction—and offers
        practical exercises to integrate them. Perfect for those who want
        to become self‑guided in their growth and learn tools to coach
        others. Come develop mastery in the art of self‑understanding and
        relational intelligence.
