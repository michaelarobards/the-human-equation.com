    <h2>Why We Have Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
      The Human Equation is not just a platform—it’s a living community. In order to protect the emotional
      safety of every person who shows up, we have agreements about how we speak to each other, how we
      share information, and how we hold space. Please read these guidelines carefully before
      participating in any of our groups, workshops, or online spaces.
    </p>

    <h2>Respect & Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>
      Our groups are confidential and judgment-free spaces. Everything shared by members stays
      within the group—no recording, screenshotting, or retelling of another person’s story. Speak
      to others with respect, curiosity, and compassion. We do not tolerate shaming, name-calling, or
      discriminatory language of any kind.
    </p>

    <h2>This Is Not Therapy</h2>
    <p>
      The Human Equation provides psychoeducational groups and peer support. While Michael
      A. RoBards, LCSW is a licensed clinician, these community programs are <strong>not</strong> a substitute for
      individual psychotherapy or emergency mental‑health care. If you are in crisis, please contact
      local emergency services, a crisis hotline, or your personal therapist. Our groups do not
      constitute a therapist–client relationship.
    </p>

    <h2>Participation & Attendance</h2>
    <p>
      Groups work best when people show up consistently. If you commit to a membership tier that
      includes weekly sessions, we ask that you attend as often as possible and communicate
      proactively if you will miss a session. Late arrivals and “ghosting” the group negatively
      impact the container. If you anticipate a long absence, please discuss options with your
      facilitator.
    </p>

    <h2>Listening & Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      When someone else is speaking, listen without planning your response. We practice
      non‑interruption and reflective listening. Share from your own experience using “I” statements
      rather than giving unsolicited advice. If you are uncertain about what’s appropriate to share,
      ask the facilitator.
    </p>

    <h2>Leadership & Boundaries</h2>
    <p>
      Some groups rotate leadership among members. When it’s your turn to facilitate, we provide
      structure and support. Facilitators maintain time boundaries, guide the conversation, and
      ensure that no single person dominates the space. If conflict arises, bring it to the
      facilitator privately so it can be handled with care.
    </p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property & Materials</h2>
    <p>
      The Insight Game, Identity Pie, CARE‑PES framework, and other materials shared in our
      programs are intellectual property owned by The Human Equation, The Leadership Dimension,
      and the Estate of Martine J. RoBards, Ph.D. Please do not reproduce or distribute these
      materials without written permission. They are offered for your personal growth and not for
      commercial use.
    </p>

    <h2>Acknowledgment & Agreement</h2>
    <p>
      By participating in The Human Equation’s groups, workshops, or online community, you agree to
      abide by these guidelines. If a facilitator feels that a participant is not aligned with
      our values, they may be asked to leave the group or modify their behavior. We strive to
      protect the safety and dignity of every member.
