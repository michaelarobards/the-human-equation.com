# Modern Fatherhood Companion Workbook

## Introduction
Modern fatherhood is in the middle of an identity revolution. Men can’t parent from the models they inherited. This workbook helps you understand your blueprint, identify your wounds, break patterns, and build a new identity rooted in humility, presence, and leadership. It blends clinical tools, leadership psychology, personal development practices, memoir reflections, and Insight principles.

## Module 1 — Your Inherited Blueprint
**Exercise 1A — Your Father Figures Map**
List every male or masculine influence that shaped your model of fatherhood (biological father, stepfathers, coaches, brothers, uncles, bosses, father-in-law, pastors, fictional characters, friends’ fathers, cultural icons).

| Father Figure | Role in Your Life | What He Taught You | How It Shows Up Now |
|--------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
|              |                  |                    |                      |
|              |                  |                    |                      |
|              |                  |                    |                      |

*Reflection:* Which man had the strongest emotional impact on you, and how does his presence (or absence) still shape your behavior today?

## Module 2 — The Three Archetypes
Identify your default pattern under stress:

- Absent Father: emotionally distant, distracted, avoidant.
- Chaotic Father: reactive, unpredictable, volatile.
- Overcorrected Father: rigid, anxious, controlling.

*Worksheet:* Check the patterns that apply; note your behavioral cues; identify which Insight preferences intensify the pattern.

## Module 3 — The Father Wound
Complete: “My father wounded me by…” Choose categories (absence, silence, unpredictability, harshness, neglect, emotional unavailability, never apologizing, perfectionism, addiction, rage, never saying “I’m proud of you,” never saying “I love you,” leaving the family, making everything your fault, never seeing you).

*Worksheet: The Father Wound Impact Grid*

| Category | How It Affected You As a Child | How It Shows Up in You As a Father |
|---------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|         |                                |                                   |
|         |                                |                                   |
|         |                                |                                   |

*Prompt:* What did you need from your father that you never received?

## Module 4 — The New Model of Fatherhood
Six pillars worksheets:

1. Presence > Performance: Identify what you do consistently and what you do intensely. Rewrite one intense behavior into a consistent one.
2. Leadership Through Humility: Write three moments where you could have said “I’m sorry — that was my fault.” Rewrite them as if you had responded with humility.
3. Self-Regulation: Note bodily sensations when triggered; list three regulation tools (breathing, walking away, naming the emotion).
4. Consistency Over Intensity: Evaluate and adjust consistency versus intensity in your parenting.
5. Emotional Literacy: Identify three emotions you struggled to express; practice modeling them.
6. Pattern Breaking: Circle the pattern you’re ending (silence, anger, emotional distance, perfectionism, overcontrol, withdrawal). Finish: “This pattern ends with me.”

## Module 5 — The Co-Parenting Battlefield
**Exercise 5A — The Impossible Moments Inventory**
List three co-parenting moments that triggered your ego. Identify the underlying emotion (shame, fear, helplessness, loss of control, inadequacy).

**Exercise 5B — Co-Parenting Skill Check**
Rate yourself (1–10) on emotional regulation, non-reactive communication, separating kid-issues from parent-issues, holding boundaries, and ability to repair. Choose one to improve this month.

## Module 6 — The Father You Are Becoming
Complete:

1. The father I refuse to be is…
2. The father I choose to become is…
3. My child will know me as a father who…
4. The pattern I’m ending ends with…

**Commitment statement:** “I am not the father I inherited; I am the father I choose to become.” Sign and date.
