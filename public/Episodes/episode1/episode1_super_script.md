# Human Equation Live — Episode 1 Super-Script (Production Ready)

## Cold Open — "Is this thing on?"

"Is this thing on? … alright. Here we go."

Talking to a camera is weird. There's no face looking back, no breath, no micro-expression to read. As a therapist, that’s like flying without instruments.

When I look into the lens, I picture my kids. And the thousands of people I've worked with over the last twenty years—parents, couples, teenagers, families in crisis, families rebuilding, people finding themselves. Those are my people, and when I picture them my voice comes naturally.

This livestream—Human Equation Live—is new. But the heart of it began decades ago. It began in the 1980s… in Laguna Beach… inside a place called The Human Equation. Tonight, I’m going to take you there and show you how everything—my memoir, the Insight game, this community, these groups, this movement—connects.

## Section 1 — Origin Story: Laguna Beach & The Human Equation

The Human Equation was not a clinic. It wasn’t a therapy office or a bookstore; it was a magnificent spectacle: 4,000 square feet on Pacific Coast Highway, steps from the sand. Curved walls, meditation rooms, a self-help bookstore, exquisite furniture, and a gourmet espresso bar— in 1982. Soft rose-and-green lighting, new age music, artists doing workshops, therapists working with clients, couples sitting in Insight sessions.

This was my mother’s creation. Dr. Martine Robards: neuroscientist, psychotherapist, pioneer. She taught gross anatomy at UC Irvine, studied shark brains, worked at Brown and UVA, and then pivoted into psychology. She built The Human Equation as a sanctuary. I grew up inside it, and it shaped everything.

## Section 2 — Memoir Integration

Laguna Beach wasn’t just beautiful; it was complicated, glamorous, dangerous, and transformative. There were cliffside houses, celebrities, and also addiction, secrecy, violence, and deep ruptures. My memoir tells the story of this world—the rise, the shattering, the reconstruction—and the crucible that shaped my clinical work and this community.

## Section 3 — The Insight Series: Then & Now

While The Human Equation was a place, Insight was the framework. My mother created the Insight Personality Game to teach communication, emotional intelligence, relationships, conflict styles, processing styles, leadership, teamwork, and personal growth. It was the Myers-Briggs before MBTI became popular, but more relational and dynamic.

Insight taught people how they process information, how they talk, why they repeat patterns. Now, my son Zach and I are reviving Insight—as a board game, digital assessment, community tool, learning system, and eventually an AI-supported model. Insight 2.0 will be the backbone of personal development, group identity, communication training, conflict resolution, community-building, and courses. The through-line is simple: people transform faster when they understand themselves; people heal faster when they understand each other.

## Section 4 — 20 Years of Clinical Work

After 20 years of clinical work I’ve developed a lens on:

* Family court and co-parenting: why court doesn’t heal families. Court is adversarial; families require collaboration.
* Reunification therapy: rebuilding requires structure, safety, pacing, and attunement.
* Modern fatherhood: the 50/50 myth traps men; fatherhood is measured by leadership, humility, consistency, and presence.
* Identity reconstruction: how to rebuild after divorce, betrayal, or transitions.
* Trauma and betrayal: emotional withdrawal can be more destructive than conflict.
* Individual therapy transforms relationships.
* The Identity Pie: mismatched roles create emotional landmines in co-parenting.

## Section 5 — AI, Ethics & the Future of Mental Health

AI won’t replace therapy, but it can extend it. My CARE-PES framework ensures ethical, cultural, unbiased, monitored AI in practice. For people with ADHD, AI supports routines, task breakdown, capturing thoughts, and reducing overwhelm. The Human Equation will integrate AI carefully, to extend the therapeutic environment between sessions.

## Section 6 — Weekly Schedule & Group Overview

Here is our weekly rhythm. Each group exists for a reason. Each group solves a human problem and connects to a chapter of my life or work. The groups are:

- **Modern Fatherhood**: For fathers navigating co-parenting, rebuilding, or learning emotional leadership.
- **Modern Motherhood**: For mothers carrying unseen emotional labor, building identity and boundaries.
- **Co-Ed Growth & Development**: For anyone ready to break patterns and align their life.
- **Parents of Teens**: For parents dealing with digital overload, identity exploration, anxiety, and boundaries.
- **Co-Parenting & Divorce Recovery**: For those rebuilding identity and parenting after separation.
- **Trauma, Grief & Transformation**: For people carrying grief or trauma; focusing on meaning-making and resilience.
- **Identity, Purpose & Reinvention**: For those reinventing themselves after life transitions.
- **Saturday Community Live**: Weekly gathering to share insights, wins, challenges, upcoming topics.

## Section 7 — Closing: Welcome to The Human Equation

If you’re here, you’re helping finish what my mother began in 1982. She believed people could understand themselves deeply, that healing is a science and an art. Now we’re building a new Human Equation together—to help people understand themselves and each other, and transform their lives.
