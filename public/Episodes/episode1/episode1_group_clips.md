# Group Intro Scripts for Episode 1

## Modern Fatherhood Group
Men don’t get many safe places. Fathers carry pressures: unspoken expectations, co-parenting conflict, identity collapse. In the Modern Fatherhood Group, men learn emotional leadership—through humility, presence, and accountability. This group draws on my clinical work and personal story. If you’re a dad navigating co-parenting, rebuilding your life, or wanting to show up better for your kids, this group is for you.

## Modern Motherhood Group
Motherhood carries invisible labor and unacknowledged weight. This group is built on the teachings I learned from my mother—a scientist, therapist, and single mom. It’s also informed by decades of sitting with mothers in crisis and reinvention. In the Modern Motherhood Group, mothers find community, identity, boundaries, and strength.

## Co-Ed Personal Growth & Development Group
Not everything fits into a category. Divorce, identity, anxiety, trauma, transitions affect all of us. This group is the modern version of what my mom built at The Human Equation—a place where anyone can go deeper into their story. We explore identity, communication, resilience, purpose, and alignment using Insight and narrative therapy.

## Parents of Teens Group
Parenting a teenager today is like parenting on expert mode. Screens, identity exploration, anxiety, depression—everything is amplified. This group helps parents navigate communication, boundaries, digital overwhelm, gender identity, mental health, and family systems.

## Co-Parenting & Divorce Recovery Group
Divorce is an identity earthquake. It shifts roles, collapses routines, and challenges self-worth. This group helps parents rebuild identity, navigate conflict, and co-parent without losing themselves. It covers conflict resolution, communication, emotional steadiness, boundaries, identity reconstruction, and protecting children emotionally.

## Trauma, Grief & Transformation Group
Grief and trauma rearrange identity. This group offers sacred space for those who’ve experienced loss or trauma. We focus on community, nervous system regulation, meaning-making, identity reconstruction, and resilience.

## Identity, Purpose & Reinvention Group
This group helps you explore who you’re becoming after major transitions. It uses Insight, values clarification, narrative therapy, and self-reflection to rebuild identity and align your life with your purpose.

## Saturday Community Live
Every Saturday, all groups come together for our Week in Review. We reflect on the week, preview upcoming topics, share wins, and build connection. This is the community’s town square.
