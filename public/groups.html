  <p>
    Healing doesn’t happen in isolation. Most people don’t need another book or strategy — they need a 
    consistent place to show up, be witnessed, and grow alongside others navigating similar seasons of life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each group inside <strong>The Human Equation</strong> is designed to help you rebuild identity, strengthen 
    relationships, regulate emotions, and feel supported as you move through parenting, co-parenting, adulthood, 
    or transitions.
  </p>
  <p>
    All groups are included with <a href="/membership.html">Standard</a> and <a href="/membership.html">Premium Memberships</a>.

    <h2>Monday Groups — Parenting & Family Identity</h2>

    <h3>Parenting Autistic Kids & Teens</h3>
    <p>
      A compassionate, practical space for parents navigating neurodivergence, emotional regulation,
      sensory needs, school systems, and the pressure of being “on” all the time.
    </p>

    <h3>Parenting Teens</h3>
    <p>
      A steady, grounded space for the hardest stage of parenting — when your child is changing faster than 
      you can adjust. Learn communication strategies, boundaries, and identity tools.
    </p>

    <h3>Parents of Trans & Gender-Nonconforming Youth</h3>
    <p>
      For parents committed to supporting their child's identity, safety, emotional development, and 
      family relationships with clarity and compassion.
    </p>

    <h3>Parents Grief Circle (Sacred Space)</h3>
    <p>
      For parents grieving estrangement, identity shifts, or the loss of a relationship with a child. 
      A quiet, respectful space for healing.
    </p>

    <h3>Survivors of Suicide (Parents & Loved Ones)</h3>
    <p>
      A grounding, community-based support circle for navigating the aftermath of suicide loss 
      and reconstructing meaning after unimaginable grief.

      career direction, and masculine development without shame.
    </p>

    <h3>20s LGBTQ Group — Identity, Belonging, Emotional Strength</h3>

      A supportive, queer-centered community for self-discovery, relationship dynamics, emotional

  <div style="max-width: 850px; margin: auto;">
    <h2>Saturday Groups — Adult Identity & Transformation</h2>

    <h3>Modern Fatherhood</h3>
    <p>
      Fatherhood is an identity — not a task list. This group helps men rebuild integrity, emotional 
      regulation, co-parenting skill, and connection with their children.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern Motherhood</h3>
    <p>
      For women carrying emotional, logistical, and invisible labor. A space to reclaim identity, reduce 
      overwhelm, and build a self that doesn’t disappear inside parenting.
    </p>
