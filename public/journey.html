    <h1>Your Journey: From Newcomer to Builder</h1>
    <p>Growth isn’t a single moment—it’s a progression. Here’s how our community supports you, every step of the way.</p>

    <h2>Newcomer</h2>
    <p>
      Your first visit can feel like walking into a room of strangers. You might not know what to expect
      or whether you even belong here. In this phase, all you have to do is show up. Listen to
      others’ stories. Take in the culture. Notice what resonates. There’s no pressure to speak or
      participate—you’re simply getting a feel for the space and seeing if it feels right for you.
    </p>

    <h2>Member</h2>
    <p>
      Over time you begin to attend regularly. You introduce yourself. You start to share your own
      experiences. You learn our frameworks—Identity Pie, Values Clarification, conflict mastery
      practices—and you practice them with a small group of people who see you week after week.
      Consistency builds trust, and trust creates the safety needed for real growth. In this phase
      you begin to set goals and hold yourself accountable to them.
    </p>

    <h2>Contributor</h2>
    <p>
      Once you feel more confident, you naturally start to give back. You co‑facilitate breakout
      exercises, suggest discussion topics, or share resources that have helped you. You might
      pair up with another member to lead part of a session or volunteer to welcome newcomers.
      Contribution isn’t about expertise—it’s about willingness to serve and to model vulnerability
      for others.
    </p>

    <h2>Builder</h2>
    <p>
      When a group reaches around ten members, we split to keep the circle intimate. Builders step
      into leadership roles to help launch these new circles. With support and supervision from our
      professional facilitators, Builders create meeting agendas, help set the tone, and ensure
      everyone’s voice is heard. This stage is about paying forward the care you’ve received and
      helping our community grow organically. Builders are the heartbeat of The Human Equation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wherever you are in your journey, know that there is a place for you. Growth happens through
      repetition, reflection, and relationship. Our community is here to walk with you from your very
      first meeting to the day you lead others. We’re honored to witness your evolution.
