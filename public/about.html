<!-- ======================== SECTION 1 — THE MOMENT EVERYTHING CHANGED ======================== -->
<section class="white-block fade-up">
  <div class="container">

    <h2>The Moment Everything Changed</h2>

    <p>
      The moment I learned what healing really requires wasn’t in graduate school — it was in the middle
      of my own life falling apart. Like many of the fathers, mothers, and couples I now work with,
      I didn’t just <em>study</em> these systems. I survived them.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a particular silence that settles over a home when a family system begins to fracture —
      a silence full of questions you’re not ready to ask and answers you’re not prepared to hear.
    </p>

    <p>
      I found myself inside that silence once, navigating the disorientation of identity collapse,
      co-parenting pressure, grief, and the rebuilding of a life that no longer made sense in its old form.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I discovered — painfully at first, then with clarity — is that people don’t break.
      <strong>Stories break.</strong><br>
      Identities break. Relationships break under unmet needs, inherited patterns, and unfinished grief.
      But people? People can be rebuilt.
    </p>

    <p>
      And in that realization, <strong>The Human Equation</strong> was born — a community and framework for rebuilding identity,
      connection, and meaning.
    </p>

  </div>
</section>



<!-- ======================== SECTION 2 — FAMILY LEGACY ======================== -->
<section class="white-block fade-up">
  <div class="container">

    <h2>A Family Legacy in Psychology and Human Systems</h2>

    <p>
      My introduction to human behavior began long before my clinical career — with my mother,
      <strong>Dr. Martine J. RoBards</strong>, a psychologist, neuroscientist, and pioneer in personality systems,
      organizational development, and type-temperament theory.
    </p>

    <p>
      I grew up surrounded by the language of identity, values, human systems, and the strange, beautiful ways
      people try to make meaning.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “People are not problems. They are systems — rich, complex, adaptive systems waiting to be understood.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Her work became the foundation I stand on today.  
      The Human Equation continues that lineage — translating deep psychological and systems-based frameworks into tools real people can actually use to rebuild themselves.
    </p>

<!-- ======================== SECTION 3 — PROFESSIONAL STORY ======================== -->
<section class="white-block fade-up">
  <div class="container">

    <h2>The Professional Story (The Part That Looks Good on Paper)</h2>

    <p>I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker with more than 20 years of experience specializing in:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Family therapy & reunification therapy</li>
      <li>High-conflict divorce & co-parenting systems</li>
      <li>Men’s identity work & modern fatherhood</li>
      <li>Attachment repair & relationship reconstruction</li>
      <li>Narrative therapy & identity re-authoring</li>
      <li>Trauma-informed clinical practice</li>
      <li>AI ethics in mental health (CARE-PES framework)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My career has included:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Directing inpatient and outpatient psychiatric programs</li>
      <li>Serving as Associate Director of Operations for residential treatment</li>
      <li>Hundreds of reunification and high-stakes co-parenting cases</li>
      <li>Consulting with legal teams, physicians, and clinicians</li>
      <li>Developing identity-based therapeutic frameworks and assessment models</li>
      <li>Teaching individuals, parents, and professionals how to navigate relational systems with clarity and integrity</li>
    </ul>

  </div>
</section>



<!-- ======================== SECTION 4 — PHILOSOPHY ======================== -->
<section class="white-block fade-up">
  <div class="container">

    <h2>Healing Happens in Community</h2>

    <p>
      Therapy matters — deeply.  
      But therapy is not the entire story.
    </p>

    <p>People heal more sustainably when:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>they are witnessed, not judged;</li>
      <li>they belong to something larger than their pain;</li>
      <li>they practice connection, not isolation;</li>
      <li>they have spaces where truth is safe to speak;</li>
      <li>they are guided, not rescued.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is why <strong>The Human Equation</strong> is built not as a clinic, but as a community —
      a steady relational structure where identity can be rebuilt through belonging, practice, and shared language.
    </p>

  </div>
</section>



<!-- ======================== SECTION 5 — INSIGHT SERIES ======================== -->
<section class="white-block fade-up">
  <div class="container">

    <h2>The Insight Series: Tools for Rebuilding Yourself</h2>

    <blockquote>
      “When a person loses their story, they lose their self.  
      When they reclaim their story, they reclaim everything.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Insight Series helps people:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>understand their personality and temperament patterns;</li>
      <li>repair attachment injuries;</li>
      <li>reconstruct identity after divorce or loss;</li>
      <li>clarify their values and priorities;</li>
      <li>develop relational intelligence;</li>
      <li>build lives that are internally congruent rather than externally performed.</li>
    </ul>

</section>



<!-- ======================== SECTION 6 — WHY I BUILT THIS ======================== -->
<section class="white-block fade-up">
  <div class="container">

    <h2>Why I Built This Community</h2>

    <p>Because no one should have to navigate identity collapse alone.</p>
    <p>Because men deserve spaces where masculinity is conversation, not performance.</p>
    <p>Because parents deserve support that isn’t filtered through conflict.</p>
    <p>Because couples deserve a chance to repair before they resign.</p>
    <p>Because people deserve to feel like the authors of their own lives again.</p>

    <p>
      Healing is a human equation — one we solve together.
